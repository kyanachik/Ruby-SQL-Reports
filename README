Ruby SQL Reports is a library (to be turned into a gem) that will call a Microsoft SQL Reports server through the SOAP protocol with optional parameters and return back a PDF file of the requested report.

This library was designed within a Ruby on Rails application and the folder structure is setup as such, but in reality the code can be used in any Ruby project.

==Required Gems==
The following gems are required for the library:
* savon (gem install savon).  This library was written using 0.8.1

==The Code==
The main code lies in the /lib/sqlreports.rb file.  It expects two global configuration hashes, one called SQLREPORTS_CONFIG and the other called SQLREPORTS_REPORTS.  The intiailizer for rails can be found in the /config/initiailizers/load_sqlreports_config.rb file. 

==Sql Reports Configuration==
The /configsqlreports.yml file defines the url and authentication for the SQL Reports servers for your environments and a reports configuration that easily defines the locations of all of your reports on the server.

[environment]:
  server: SQLReportServerName
  username: username
  password: password

reports:
  reportid1: /Location on SQL Reports Server
  reportid2: /Location on SQL Reports Server

==Calling a SQL Report==
1. Create an array of report parameters
2. Call the SqlReports print_report method passing the reportid of the report as defined in the config file and the report parameters
3. (Optionally) A Rails controller can stream the rendered PDF as a file.

  report_parameters = [
    {:Name => "id", :Value => "1" }
  ]

  pdffile = Sqlreports.print_report 'reportid1', report_parameters

  send_data(pdffile, :filename => "FileName.pdf", :type => "application/pdf")
